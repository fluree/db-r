//! # Garbage Collection
//!
//! Garbage collection for content-addressed storage (CID-based).
//!
//! During index building, CAS artifacts (dicts, branches, leaves) that are no
//! longer referenced by the new root are recorded in a garbage manifest.
//! The GC collector walks the `prev_index` chain, identifies gc-eligible roots,
//! and deletes their obsolete artifacts.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! 1. **During build**: Compute `old_root.all_cas_ids() \ new_root.all_cas_ids()`
//! 2. **After build**: Write a garbage record with the obsolete CID strings
//! 3. **On-demand cleanup**: Walk the prev-index chain, identify eligible garbage,
//!    and delete CAS artifacts by deriving storage addresses from CIDs
//!
//! ## Garbage Record Format
//!
//! Garbage records are CAS-written JSON containing sorted/deduped CID strings
//! (base32-lower multibase). Each record includes a `created_at_ms` wall-clock
//! timestamp for time-based retention checks. Because of the timestamp, records
//! are indexer-specific (not deterministic across concurrent indexers), but this
//! is harmless since only one indexer wins the publish race.
//!
//! The collector resolves CID strings back to storage addresses using
//! `content_address()` for deletion.
//!
//! ## Time-Based Retention
//!
//! GC respects two thresholds:
//! - `max_old_indexes`: Maximum number of old index versions to keep (default: 5)
//! - `min_time_garbage_mins`: Minimum age before an index can be GC'd (default: 30)
//!
//! Both thresholds must be satisfied for GC to occur.
