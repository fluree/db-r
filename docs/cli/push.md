# fluree push

Push local ledger changes to upstream remote, similar to `git push`.

## Usage

```bash
fluree push [LEDGER]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `[LEDGER]` | Ledger name (defaults to active ledger) |

## Description

Pushes **local commits** to the configured upstream remote by uploading the commit v2 bytes to the server.

The ledger must have an upstream configured (see `fluree upstream set`).

The push uses strict sequencing + CAS semantics:

- The server rejects the push if the remote head is not in your local history (diverged) or if the remote is ahead.
- The server also rejects the push if the first commit’s `t` does not match the server’s next-t.

Unlike `fetch`/`pull`, this is **not** a storage-proxy replication operation. It requires **write** permissions for the ledger (Bearer token with `fluree.ledger.write.*` claims) and the server validates the pushed commits like normal transactions.

If a pushed commit contains **retractions**, the server enforces a strict invariant: each retraction must target a fact that is currently asserted at that point in the push batch. (List retractions require exact list-index metadata match.)

## Examples

```bash
# Push active ledger
fluree push

# Push specific ledger
fluree push mydb
```

## Output

Successful push:
```
Pushing 'mydb:main' to 'origin'...
✓ 'mydb:main' pushed 3 commit(s) (new head t=42)
```

Push rejected (remote is ahead):
```
Pushing 'mydb:main' to 'origin'...
error: push rejected; remote is ahead (local t=10, remote t=42). Pull first.
```

No upstream configured:
```
error: no upstream configured for 'mydb:main'
  hint: fluree upstream set mydb:main <remote>
```

## Errors

| Error | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No upstream configured | Run `fluree upstream set <ledger> <remote>` first |
| Push rejected (409) | Remote head changed, histories diverged, or first commit `t` does not match next-t |
| Push rejected (422) | Invalid commit bytes, missing required referenced blob, or retraction invariant violation |

## Workflow

Typical sync workflow:

```bash
# Configure remote and upstream (one time)
fluree remote add origin https://api.example.com --token @~/.fluree/token
fluree upstream set mydb origin

# Daily workflow
fluree pull mydb        # Get latest changes
# ... make local changes ...
fluree push mydb        # Push your changes
```
